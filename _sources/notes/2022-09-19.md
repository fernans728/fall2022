# Why Do I Need to Use a terminal?



1. replication/automation
1. more universal
1. cloud computing/ HPC often only have a terminal
1. some more powerful actions are only available on a terminal

We will go back to the same repository we worked with on Friday, for me that was

```bash
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-in-class-brownsarahm/
```

## Review

We use `git status` to check on the state of a git repo.

If we get an error that says this is not a git repo, it means there is no `.git` directory in our current working directory or its parents.

```bash
ls
README.md	about.md

```


```bash
ls -a
.		.git		README.md
..		.github		about.md

```


```bash
cd .git
(base) brownsarahm@.git $ ls
COMMIT_EDITMSG	description	info		packed-refs
HEAD		hooks		logs		refs
config		index		objects
(base) brownsarahm@.git $ cd ..

```

Parents mean working to the left in the path and children are to the right.
```bash
pwd
```

So `systems` is a child of `inclass` and the parent directory of `github-inclass-brownsarahm`
```
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-brownsarahm

```


## Scenario

```{note}
A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the *task* that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project
```


```bash
touch abstract_base_class.py helper_functions.py important_classes.py alternative_classes.py README.md LICENSE.md CONTRIBUTING.md setup.py tests_abc.py test_help.py test_imp.py test_alt.py overview.md API.md _config.yml

```


```bash
touch _toc.yml philosophy.md example.md Untitled.ipynb Untitled01.ipynb Untitled02.ipynb
```


```bash
ls
```

Now we have all of these files,  named in abstract ways to
signal hypothetical contents and suggest how to organize them.

```
API.md			_toc.yml		philosophy.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		setup.py
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py
_config.yml		overview.md

```


```bash
cat README.md
# github-inclass-brownsarahm
github-inclass-brownsarahm created by GitHub Classroom

```

We can add contents to files with `echo` and `>>`

```bash
echo "Sarah Brown" >> README.md

```


```bash
cat README.md
# github-inclass-brownsarahm
github-inclass-brownsarahm created by GitHub Classroom
Sarah Brown

```
### one versus two >>

```bash
cat about.md
```


```bash
echo "a sample project" >> about.md
```


```bash

 echo "testing one >" > about.md

```

One *writes* a file and two *appends*


```bash
cat about.md
testing one >

```


```bash
 echo "|file | contents |
> | ------| ------- |
> | abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
> | helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
> | important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> | alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> | LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
> | CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
> | setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
> | tests_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|

> | tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
> | API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
> | _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
> | _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
> | philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
> | example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
> | scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |" >> README.md

```

this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.


```bash
cat README.md
```

```

```

```{note}
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes
```

```bash

 echo " kasdlkfjsdljf
> kjsdfksdj
> sdfjdsl
> fsklsdjf
> "
 kasdlkfjsdljf
kjsdfksdj
sdfjdsl
fsklsdjf


```
You can use the up arrow to repeat a command

```bash

 echo " kasdlkfjsdljf
kjsdfksdj
sdfjdsl
fsklsdjf
" >> junk

```
and we can see that it keeps the new line characters from the terminal in the file.

```bash

 cat junk
 kasdlkfjsdljf
kjsdfksdj
sdfjdsl
fsklsdjf


```


```bash
rm junk
```


## Making Directories

First we will make directories. We saw `mkdir` on Friday


```bash
mkdir docs

```

This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`
```
ls
```

```
API.md			_toc.yml		overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		philosophy.md
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			test_help.py
Untitled01.ipynb	example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled02.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py
```


We might not want to make them all one at a time. Like with `touch` we can
pass multiple names to mkdir with spaces between to make multiple at once.



```bash
mkdir tests mymodule

```


```bash
ls
```
and again check what happened

```
API.md			about.md		philosophy.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
README.md		docs			test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		example.md		test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		mymodule
_toc.yml		overview.md

```



## Moving files

we can move files with `mv`. We'll first move the philosophy.md file into docs
and check that it worked.

```bash
mv philosophy.md docs/
```


```bash
mv example.md docs/
```


### Getting help in bash
To learn more about the mv command, we can use the man(ual) file.

For GitBash:
```bash
mv --help
```

for *nix (including macos)

````{margin}
```{important}
press `q` to exit the program that starts when you do this.
```
````

```bash
man mv
```

use enter/return or arrows to scroll and `q` to quit

If we type something wrong, the error message also provides some help
```
mv ls
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
```

We can use man on any bash command to see the options so we do not need to
remember them all, or go to the internet every time we need help.  We have high
quality help for the details right in the shell, if we remember the basics.




### Moving multiple files with patterns


let's look at the list of files again.

```bash
ls
```

```
API.md			_toc.yml		overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		setup.py
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
README.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_config.yml		mymodule

```


```bash
cat README.md
```
```
# github-inclass-brownsarahm
github-inclass-brownsarahm created by GitHub Classroom
Sarah Brown
|file | contents |
| ------| ------- |
| abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
| helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
| important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
| setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |

| tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
| tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
| API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
| _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
| _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
| philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
| example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
| scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |

```


````{margin}
```{note}
this is why good file naming is important even if you have not organized the
whole project yet, you can use the good conventions to help yourself later.
```
````

 We see that the ones with similar purposes have similar names.

We can use `*` as a wildcard operator and then move will match files to that
pattern and move them all. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.

```bash
mv *.yml docs/

```


```bash

 ls
API.md			about.md		overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
README.md		docs			test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	mymodule		tests_abc.py

```



### Renaming a single file with mv

We see that most of the test files start with `test_` but one starts with
`tests_`. We could use the pattern `test*.py` to move them all without
conflicting with the directory `tests/` but we also want consistent names.

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.
```
mv tests_abc.py test_abc.py
ls
```
now that it's fixed
```
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_abc.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_alt.py
README.md		example.md		test_help.py
Untitled.ipynb		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
Untitled01.ipynb	important_classes.py	tests
Untitled02.ipynb	mymodule
about.md		overview.md
```



```bash
mv test_* tests/
```
```{note}
In class I did the mv tests* before renaming and we did not have to rename.  This way is cleaner, but that way worked, albiet with an error
```


```bash
ls
```
```
API.md			Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		mymodule
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	overview.md
README.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			tests
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py

```


```bash
ls tests/
test_alt.py	test_help.py	test_imp.py	test_abc.py

```


```bash
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled02.ipynb	important_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		about.md		mymodule
LICENSE.md		abstract_base_class.py	overview.md
README.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
Untitled.ipynb		docs			tests
Untitled01.ipynb	helper_functions.py

```



Now we can move all of the other .py files to the module
```bash
mv *.py mymodule/
ls
```


## Working with relative paths

Let's review our info again
```
...
|file | contents |
| ------| ------- |
| abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
| helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
| important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
| LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
| setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
| tests_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
| tests_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
| tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
| tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
| API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
| _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
| _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
| philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
| example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
| scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |
```

We've made a mistake, `setup.py` is actually instructions that need to be at the
top level, not inside the module's sub directory.

We can get it back using the relative path to the file and then using `.` to
move it to where we "are" sicne we are in the top level directory still.

```bash
mv mymodule/setup.py .
ls
```

```
API.md			Untitled01.ipynb	overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled02.ipynb	setup.py
LICENSE.md		about.md		tests
README.md		docs
Untitled.ipynb		mymodule

```


Or, if we put it back temporarily
```bash
mv setup.py mymodule/
```

We can cd to where we put it
```bash
cd mymodule/
ls
```
abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py	setup.py
alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
```


and move it up a level using `..`
```bash
mv setup.py ..
```

and then go back
```bash
cd ..

```

Now we'll move the last few docs files.
```
mv API.md docs/
mv example.md docs/
```

```bash
ls
API.md			Untitled01.ipynb	overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		Untitled02.ipynb	setup.py
LICENSE.md		about.md		tests
README.md		docs
Untitled.ipynb		mymodule

```

## More relative paths

We need a `__init__.py` in the mymodule directory but we are in the docs
directory currently.
No problem!

```bash
touch mymodule/__init__.py
```


```bash
ls mymodule/
__init__.py		alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py

```


## Copying

The typical contents of the README we would also want in the documentation
website.  We might add to the file later, but that's a good start.  We can do
that by copying.

When we copy we designate the file to copy and a path/name for the copy we want
to make.

```bash
cp README.md docs/overview.md
```


```bash
cp about.md docs/
```


```bash
ls docs/
_config.yml	about.md	overview.md
_toc.yml	example.md	philosophy.md

```


```bash
cat about.md
testing one >

```


```bash
cat docs/about.md
testing one >

```


## Removing files

We still have to deal with the untitled files that we know we don't need any more.

````{sidebar} Tab completion

If we type
```
rm U
```
then it canot tab complete the whole file name we get only

```
rm Untitled
```

because there are multiple.  If we
prest tab twice in a row, it will return the list of possible options  
```
Untitled.ipynb    Untitled01.ipynb  Untitled02.ipynb  
```
and re-seed the input with
```
rm Untitled
```
so we can type whatever else we want to add to pick the one we want.

````

we can delete them with `rm` and use `*` to delete them all.

```bash
rm Untitled*

```


```bash

 ls
API.md		LICENSE.md	about.md	mymodule	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	docs		overview.md	tests

```


```bash

 mv API.md docs/
```

## Git Order of operations

```{important}
We did not push in class, but you are supposed to so I added some tips here
```

To create and switch to a new branch at once you can use


```
git checkout -b newbranch
```

where `newbranch` is the name of your new branch

```
git status
```

Then you can see which branch you are on with `git status`
```
On branch newbranch
...
```


## Recap

Why do I need a terminal
1. replication/automation
1. it's always there and doesn't change  
1. it's faster one you know it (also see above)

```{epigraph}
So, is the shell the feature that interacts with the operating system and then the terminal is the gui that interacts with the shell?
```



```{important}
if your push gets rejected, read the hints, it probably has the answer.  We will
come back to that error though
```

## Questions After Class


### What's the difference in creating a file using touch vs echo?
`touch` creates an empty file `echo` writes content to a place.  We used with with `>` and `>>` to redirect that output to a file for today, but we will learn more about that later.

### I thought you could restore the state of the system using snapshots? Say if you remove something or something gets corrupted
You can restore if a snapshot was created, not all computers have that, and most recovery snapshots are not created very frequently (like once a day or week).

### what are other things I can do with the terminal?
There are lots of small programs and you can pipe them all together.  We will come back to the shell in the coming weeks.

### What are examples of what we are learning used in a professional setting?

Most companies use git to track their code and most dev jobs you will need to log into a server that only has a shell at some point.

### if you commit something offline and then close the terminal, can you push it next time you log on or is it lost?

Yes, the file is saved in your computer.  You do not actually even *need* to ever push it to a remote to be using git as version control.

### How can we edit files on the terminal?

To edit files in more detailed ways, you use a text editor, some are built for the command line. We will see one later.


### Where am I supposed to add the "terminal.md" file?

To your KWL repo

### Show should the team repo be laid out and should we each determine our responsibilities for them? What should be expected to be inside the team repo?

The repo has some outline in it. Remember it is *not* a team project where you are graded together.  You will have various activities assigned there throughout the semester in order to practice collaborating.  Every student will need to do every role, so that you get to learn them all.


### When will grading start?

Next week, we'll start your grading contracts on Wednesday.
