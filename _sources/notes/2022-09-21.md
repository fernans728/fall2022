# How should I use git to stay organized this class?


```{warning}
this is currently only the raw output from the shell session. Annotation will be added tomorrow
```
## How do I work with branches?

Let's go back to the github iclass repo.

```bash
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md
	modified:   about.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	docs/
	mymodule/
	overview.md
	setup.py
	tests/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

I had not pushed my content after Monday, so I have alot of files that are both not staged and fully untracked.  

We do not want to commit direcly to main in general. Working with a branch is better, becuase it gives us more option.

We can use the `-b` option for git checkout to both create a new branch and switch to it.  

```bash
git checkout -b organtzation
```

and git replies that it did what we asked.
```
Switched to a new branch 'organtzation'
```

```bash
git status
```

```{note}
Notice that this time in git status it does not compare to origin. this is because the new branch does not have a remote
```

```
On branch organtzation
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md
	modified:   about.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	docs/
	mymodule/
	overview.md
	setup.py
	tests/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

Now

```bash
git add .

```
we can commit right after staging, since we konw that is what we want.

```bash
git commit -m 'from inclass org acitivyt'
```

and it will go a bunch of things, beacuse we made a lot of changes.
```

```

Once we commit it all, we want to get it to GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

```
fatal: The current branch organtzation has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin organtzation
```

and then we can follow what git said to do

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin organtzation
```

```

 * [new branch]      organtzation -> organtzation
branch 'organtzation' set up to track 'origin/organtzation'.

```


## What happens when we start a new branch on GitHub.

Create a branch from an issue:

<iframe src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Create_a_branch__56T7g6ryTROoogzZvH_VTQ" width="640" height="640" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

```bash
git fetch
```
this step dowloads the content that is on the new branch
```
From https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-brownsarahm
 * [new branch]      2-create-an-about-file -> origin/2-create-an-about-file

```

we use git satus to see what else it did
```bash
git status
```

```
On branch organtzation
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/organtzation'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

and see that it did not change our local status, or location.

```bash
git branch
```

```
  main
* organtzation

```
but we can see the new branch isn not even in our local repo, though it has been fetched.
SO we should checkout

```bash
git checkout 2-create-an-about-file
```

```
branch '2-create-an-about-file' set up to track 'origin/2-create-an-about-file'.
Switched to a new branch '2-create-an-about-file'

```
this did a few things. It switched our local repference point, made our local directory match the remote branch, and it set the new branch to track the origin branch.


## What if we edit the file in two places?

First, we edit the file locally

```bash
echo "test" >> about.md

```

```bash
git status
```

```
On branch 2-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/2-create-an-about-file'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

```bash
cat about.md
test
```

and add and commit the changes

```bash
git add .
```


```bash
git commit -m 'start about'
```

```
[2-create-an-about-file 30c4748] start about
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Then edit the file in your browser.

Now we can try to push it from the local copy

```bash
git push
```

```
To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-brownsarahm.git
 ! [rejected]        2-create-an-about-file -> 2-create-an-about-file (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-brownsarahm.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

```
We can't push because we ahve a merge conflict.

So first, we have to pull

```bash
git pull
```

Now it tells us more about the merge conflict.

```
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

We can try the rebase option. We'll talk more about how this works in detail later, but it basically tries to undo one set of commits, apply the others then apply the first set on top.  If it cannot, then there's still a conflict.

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

```
Auto-merging about.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in about.md
error: could not apply 30c4748... start about
hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply 30c4748... start about
```

And we cannot, so we have more to do.


```bash
git status
interactive rebase in progress; onto 8ce03aa
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 30c4748 start about
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch '2-create-an-about-file' on '8ce03aa'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

We will use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) to edit.

```bash
nano about.md
```


### Resolving a Merge conflict

```
>>>>>>> HEAD
test
========
I am a Professor
<<<<<<<< 30c4748
```

Notes:
- HEAD is the current directory's content
- the other branch is indicated by its last commit number


To fix it, we manually edit the file for it to be what we want

```
test
I am a Professor
```

Then we can finish resoling

```bash
git status
```

```
interactive rebase in progress; onto 8ce03aa
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 30c4748 start about
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch '2-create-an-about-file' on '8ce03aa'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

we add and commit:
```bash
git add .

```

```bash
git status

```

```
interactive rebase in progress; onto 8ce03aa
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 30c4748 start about
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch '2-create-an-about-file' on '8ce03aa'.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md


```

```bash
git commit -m 'keep both changes'
```

```

```

```bash
git status
```

```

Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 30c4748 start about

You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch '2-create-an-about-file' on '8ce03aa'.
  (use "git commit --amend" to amend the current commit)
  (use "git rebase --continue" once you are satisfied with your changes)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

but after that, it still says that it is in the interactive rebase mode, because there is one final step to do.


```bash
git rebase --continue

```

```
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/2-create-an-about-file.

```
and finally
```bash
git status
```

```
On branch 2-create-an-about-file
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/2-create-an-about-file' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```
we see it is all set and ready to go.
```bash
git push

```

and indeed the push works!

## A note on echo

```bash
echo "hello world"
hello world

```

```bash
echo "hello world" >> hello.md
