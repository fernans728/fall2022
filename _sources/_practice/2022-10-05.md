1. Read about [git internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) to review what we did in class in greater detail. Make `gitplumbingdetail.md` by copying your `gitplumbingreview.md` and then add in the full detail including all plumbing commands. Also add one more high level command (revert, reset, pull, fetch) to your table.
2. Add to your `gitplumbingdetail.md`Â file explanations of the main git operations we have seen (add, commit, push) in your own words in a way that will either help you remember or how you would explain it to someone else at a high level. This might be analogies or explanations using other programming concepts or concepts from a hobby. Add this under a subheading `##` with a descriptive title (for example "Git In terms of <hobyb>")
3. For one thing your understanding changed or an open question you, look up or experiment to find the answer and contribute the question and answer to the course website.
