## Software Reflection


```markdown
1. link to public repo if applicable or title of your project
1. What types of files are there that are not code?
1. What different types of code files are in the project? Do they serve different goals?
1. Is it all in one language or are there multiple?
1. Try to figure out (remember) how the project works. What types of things, without running the code can you look at at a high level?
