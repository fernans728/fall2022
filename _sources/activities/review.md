# Review


## Review After Class

After each class, you will need to review the day's material. This includes reviewing prismia chat to see any questions you got wrong and reading the notes. Some days there will be specific additional activities and questions to answer.  These should be in your KWL repo.  



## Collaboration

You will be in a "team" that is your built in collaboration group to practice using Git Collaboratively.  
There will be assignments that are to be completed in that repo as well.  These activities will be marked accordingly.  You will take turns and each of you is required to do the initialization step on a recurring basis.  

This is also where you can ask questions and draft definitions to things.


## Peer Review  


If there are minor errors/typos, suggest corrections inline.

In your summary comments answer the following:
- how does the contribution read? is it clear and concise?
- is it verifiable (either testable or cited source) and correct?
- is it clear? does it rely on specific references or could another CS student understand it?
- what could make it more clear or more helpful?

Choose an action:
- If the suggestions necessary before merging, select **request changes**.  
- If it is good enough to merge, mark it **approved** and open a new issue for the broader suggestions.
- If you are unsure, post as a **comment** and invite other group members to join the discussion.
