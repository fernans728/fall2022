# Deeper Explorations


```{warning}
deeper explorations are not required, but an option for higher grades 
```

If your contract includes that you will complete deeper explorations, this page includes guidance for what is expected.

Deeper explorations can take different forms so the sections below outline some options, it is not a cumulative list of requirements.



## Where to put the work?

- If you extend a more practice exercise, you can add to the markdown file that the exercise instructs you to create.
- If its a question of your own, add a new file to your KWL repo.

## How to get it reviewed?


Follow the workflows for your [kwl repo](kwlworkflows) and tag the instructors for a review.

## What should the work look like?

It should look like a blog post or written tutorial.  It will likely contain some code excerpts the way the notes do. Style-wise it can be casual, like how you may talk through a concept with a friend or a more formal, academic tone.  What is important is that it clearly demonstrates that you understand the material.

## Examples of Deeper Explorations:
- Discussed Cryptography and Hashing in class:
    - Writing a multi-paragraph summary in a .md file of how cryptography evolved and what caused it to evolve (i.e. SHA-1 being decrypted)
- Discussed number systems:
    - Creating a .md file discussing number systems and their importance. This file could include code blocks demonstrating number system conversions.
- Discussed a topic that left you still a little confused or their was one part that you wanted to know more about. 
    - Create a .md file that details your journey from confusion or shallow understanding to a full understanding. This file would include the sources that you used to gather a deeper understanding.
